nginx basic authentication against a database

This packages answers an `nginx auth subrequest`_ by looking up the
user/password in a database (mysql, postgresql, whatever `sqlalchemy`_
supports).

Usage
=====

Configure database access
-------------------------

You'll need to provide the DSN and the query using a configuration file::

    [default]
    dsn = postgresql://localhost/myusers
    query = SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = :username AND role = :x_required_role
    password_hash = bcrypt

See the `sqlalchemy documentation`_ for supported DSNs. Note that you have to
install the respective driver python package (``mysql-python``, ``psycopg2``,
etc.) yourself.

.. _`sqlalchemy documentation`: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#database-urls

Settings beginning with ``sqlalchemy.`` are stripped of that prefix and passed through to `sqlalchemy.create_engine() <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#sqlalchemy.create_engine>`_.

The query gets passed as SQL parameters the basic auth ``username`` and
``password`` as well as any request headers (lowercase, and ``-`` replaced
with ``_``). (If that is not flexible enough for your usecase, you'll have to
run separate instances with specialized queries, for the time being).

The query must return the hashed password of the user. Since for simple cases
you might get away with using the SQL functions provided by your database to
hash the password (e.g. mysql ``WHERE password=encrypt(:password, password)``),
but you can also specify any hash supported by `passlib`_ as the
``password_hash`` to perform the comparison in Python (that's why we need the
stored password hash from the database). You need to ``pip install passlib``
to use this feature.

Set up HTTP service
-------------------

Then you need to set up an HTTP server, either with a dedicated process::

    $ nginx-db-auth-serve --host localhost --port 8899 --config /path/to/config

or as a CGI script, if you have infrastructure for that set up anyway.
Here's an example apache configuration snippet to do this::

    ScriptAlias /nginx-auth /path/to/nginxdbauth/nginx-db-auth-cgi
    <Location /nginx-auth>
      SetEnv NGINXDBAUTH_CONFIG /path/to/config
      CGIPassAuth On  # apache >= 2.4.13
      # SetEnv NGINXDBAUTH_LOGFILE /path/to/log  # optional, for debugging
    </Location>


Configure nginx
---------------

Now you can set up a protected nginx location like this::

        location /private/ {
            auth_request /auth;
            # ... define rest of location ...
        }

        location = /auth {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8899;  # or http://mycgi/nginx-auth
            proxy_pass_request_body off;
            proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
            proxy_set_header X-Required-Role "superuser";
            proxy_set_header WWW-Authenticate "Basic realm=\"my realm\"";
        }

The ``WWW-Authenticate`` header sent by nginx will simply be echoed back on 401
requests (since as far as I can tell, nginx does not provide another way to set the realm string in the ``auth_request`` case).
